**Block unwanted users from registering to your WordPress site with custom defined blacklist and whitelist rules.**

The Email Blacklist plugin will check a user trying to register to your WordPress site against defined blacklist and whitelist rules. The email blacklist plugin uses online services such as SpamAssassin's free domains list.

The email blacklist plugin stops users on blacklisted domains from registering to your WordPress site, stopping unwanted spammers, viruses and malware with one click blacklisting. The blacklist plugin also keeps a whitelist of users which can be manually updated.

The email blacklist plugin easily and effectively blocks users from registering using the blacklist function, so only approved domains or email lists can register.

The pro version includes the ability to manually add domains to the blacklist and whitelist, only allow whitelisted domains to register, and allow blacklisted users lists to be imported via csv file.

Admins can change the messages users see when they have been banned, view the failed registration log, test domains to check for blacklisted users and more.
